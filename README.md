- **Boost Profitability:** Optimize lending by targeting responsible borrowers.  
- **Enhance Customer Relationships:** Promote transparency and tailor customer interactions based on risk profiles.  
- **Enable Strategic Marketing:** Develop personalized products and services for different risk segments.  

## Solution Overview  
This project leverages data-driven techniques, including machine learning, to:  
- Analyze borrower data and identify key risk factors.  
- Develop a predictive model for accurate risk classification.  
- Provide actionable insights for loan approval, interest rate adjustments, and targeted marketing strategies.  

## Features  
- **Risk Scoring:** Assign risk scores to borrowers based on historical and behavioral data.  
- **Visual Insights:** Provide dashboards for understanding risk profiles and default trends.  
- **Actionable Recommendations:** Suggest strategies to mitigate losses and improve lending decisions.  

## Tools & Technologies
